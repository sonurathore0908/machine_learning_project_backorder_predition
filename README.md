**# machine_learning_project_backorder_predition**
This project aims to predict backorders in inventory management using machine learning techniques. Backorders occur when an item is not available in stock but is still ordered by a customer. Predicting backorders helps businesses manage inventory more effectively, reduce stockouts, and improve customer satisfaction.

**Features:-**
Data Collection: Utilizes historical sales and inventory data to train the prediction model.
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Model Building: Implements various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict backorders.
Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.
Visualization: Provides visual insights into data distributions, model performance, and prediction results.
Deployment: Integrates the model with a Flask application for real-time prediction and user interaction.

**Usage:-**
Data Preparation: Place your dataset in the data directory.
Training the Model: Run train_model.py to train the machine learning models with your dataset.
Predicting Backorders: Use the Flask app to input new data and get backorder predictions.
