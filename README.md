# machine_learning_project_backorder_predition
This project aims to predict backorders in inventory management using machine learning techniques. Backorders occur when an item is not available in stock but is still ordered by a customer. Predicting backorders helps businesses manage inventory more effectively, reduce stockouts, and improve customer satisfaction.
